Arogya Mitra : Your AI Health Companion on WhatsApp
In many parts of India, getting quick and reliable health information is a real challenge. Slow internet and language barriers can make it difficult for people in rural and semi-urban areas to get the answers they need. Sehat Saathi (Health Companion) was built to solve this problem.

It's a smart, friendly chatbot on WhatsApp that provides easy-to-understand medical information in English, Hindi, and Odia. We've optimized it to work even on slow connections, ensuring that reliable health knowledge is just a message away.

‚ú® What It Can Do
Ask Anything, Get Answers: Get clear answers to a wide range of medical questions, powered by a powerful AI trained on trusted medical knowledge.

Speaks Your Language: Chat naturally in English, Hindi, or Odia. The bot automatically detects the language and replies in the same one.

Remembers Your Conversation: Ask follow-up questions without having to repeat yourself. The bot uses Redis to remember the context of your chat.

Works on Slow Networks: We built this with low connectivity in mind. You'll get an instant "Got it, thinking..." message, so you know your query is being handled, even if your network is slow.

Analyze Health Images: Send a picture of a skin rash or an insect bite, and the AI can analyze it and provide helpful information.

Always Improving: If the bot can't answer a question, it logs it anonymously so we can improve its knowledge base over time.

Safe and Responsible: Every answer includes a clear disclaimer reminding users to consult a professional doctor for medical advice.

üèóÔ∏è How It's Built
The app is a modern backend service designed for reliability and speed:

The User: Interacts with the bot on WhatsApp.

The Gateway: Twilio securely handles all incoming and outgoing WhatsApp messages.

The Brain: A Node.js & Express server manages all the logic, from handling requests to managing conversation state.

The Memory: Redis provides a super-fast, short-term memory for each user's conversation.

The Knowledge: OpenRouter gives us access to powerful large language models (like Llama 3 and Gemini Pro Vision) to understand and answer questions.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

AI: OpenRouter (Llama 3, Gemini Pro Vision)

Messaging: Twilio API for WhatsApp

In-Memory Store: Redis
