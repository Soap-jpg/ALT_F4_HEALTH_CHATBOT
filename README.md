Arogya Mitra: AI-Powered Public Health Chatbot
Arogya Mitra (Health Companion) is an intelligent, multilingual chatbot designed to provide accessible and reliable medical information to users in rural and semi-urban areas, with a focus on optimizing for low-network conditions.

The chatbot operates on WhatsApp and can understand and respond to user queries in English, Hindi, and Odia. It leverages a powerful AI model to answer questions based on the MedQA dataset while ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.

Key Features
Conversational AI: Powered by a large language model (via OpenRouter) to understand and answer a wide range of medical questions.

Multilingual Support: Seamlessly communicates in English, Hindi, and Odia based on the user's prompt.

Conversational Memory: Uses Redis to remember the context of the last few messages, allowing for natural, multi-turn follow-up questions.

Instant Feedback for Slow Networks: Immediately sends a "Got it. Thinking..." message to reassure users on slow connections, then sends the full response when ready.

Image Recognition (Multimodal): Users can send images of medical concerns (e.g., skin rashes, insect bites) and receive an AI-powered analysis.

Unanswered Query Logging: Automatically logs questions the AI cannot answer to a text file for future analysis and improvement.

Responsible AI: Includes a mandatory disclaimer with every response to ensure users seek professional medical advice.

 Architecture
The application is built on a modern, decoupled backend architecture:

Frontend (WhatsApp): Users interact with the bot through the familiar WhatsApp interface.

Messaging Gateway (Twilio): Twilio's API for WhatsApp receives incoming messages and sends outgoing replies.

Backend Server (Node.js & Express): The core of the application. It handles incoming webhooks, manages conversation state, and orchestrates communication between services.

Short-Term Memory (Redis): Stores recent conversation history for each user, enabling contextual understanding.

AI Brain (OpenRouter): Provides access to various large language models to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.
