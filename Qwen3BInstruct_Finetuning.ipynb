This condition could allow a blood clot from the venous system, such as one from a deep vein thrombosis in the leg, to bypass the lungs and pass directly into the arterial circulation. This can occur when the clot moves from the right atrium to the left atrium through the PFO. Once in the arterial system, the clot can travel to the brain, potentially causing an embolic stroke, which would explain the sudden weakness in the left arm and leg. The connection between the recent travel, which increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis, and the neurological symptoms suggests the presence of a PFO facilitating a paradoxical embolism.'}"
